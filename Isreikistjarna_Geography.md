# Ísreikistjarna: The Sapphire Moon

**Planet Type:** Large Icy Moon / Ocean World
**System Position:** Moon of the Gas Giant (which is 1.0 AU from Mingusat)
**Orbital Distance:** ~1.2 million km from Gas Giant
**Satellites:** None (It is a satellite itself)

## Planetary Statistics

*   **Gravity:** 0.75g
*   **Diameter:** ~12,000 km (Earth-sized)
*   **Day Length:** 18 Standard Hours (Fast rotation)
*   **Year Length:** Tidally locked to Gas Giant? No, fast spin maintained. Orbit around Mingusat is ~200 Earth Days.
*   **Tidal Forces:** Significant heating from the Gas Giant drives subsurface geological activity.

## Atmosphere & Climate

*   **Pressure:** 1.0 Bar (Terraformed/Maintained)
*   **Composition:**
    *   Nitrogen: 78%
    *   Oxygen: 21%
    *   Argon/Trace: 1%
    *   *Note:* Atmosphere is breathable but cold.
*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Global Average:** -10°C to 5°C.
    *   **Equatorial Zone:** 0°C to 10°C (Artificially warmed by orbital mirrors).
    *   **Poles:** -60°C or lower.
*   **Weather:**
    *   Constant cloud cover and snow.
    *   "Diamond Dust" storms (ice crystals).
    *   Auroras are spectacular and near-constant due to interaction with the Gas Giant's magnetosphere.

## Geography & Geology

Ísreikistjarna is a water world covered by a global ice shell, similar to Europa but larger and warmer.

### Surface Features
*   **The Global Ice Sheet:** Covers 90% of the moon. Thickness varies from kilometers at the poles to mere meters at the equator.
*   **The Equatorial fracture Zone:** A belt of open water and slush kept liquid by a combination of:
    1.  Tidal heating from the Gas Giant.
    2.  Orbital mirror arrays reflecting concentrated sunlight.
    3.  Industrial waste heat from the underwater cities.
*   **Ice Cliffs:** Massive, jagged ridges formed by the shifting and colliding of ice plates.

### The Ocean
*   **Depth:** Average depth of 60-100 km. Deeper than Earth's oceans.
*   **Composition:** Salt water, rich in minerals dissolved from the rocky core.
*   **Methane Clathrates:** Vast deposits of frozen methane exist on the seafloor and within the ice shell.
    *   *Mining:* Controversial vibro-mining extracts this for fuel and export to Nüüdelchid.
    *   *Danger:* Destabilization causes massive "burps" that can fracture the ice sheet and tsunamis.

## Human Habitation

Society here is modeled on Nordic principles of cooperation, education, and sustainability, but heavily industrialized.

### Stjernelys (The Star Light)
*   **Type:** Capital City / Base Station
*   **Location:** Anchored to the thickest part of the equatorial ice sheet.
*   **Description:** A sprawling metropolis of glowing domes and modular towers.
*   **Feature:** The base of the **Bifröst Space Elevator**.

### Nova Station
*   **Type:** Orbital Counterweight / Spaceport
*   **Location:** Geosynchronous orbit (relative to the moon's spin) at the top of the ribbon.
*   **Function:** Primary export hub for the entire system. Low gravity and the elevator make it the cheapest place to ship goods off-world.

### The *Kotitila*
*   **Type:** Rural Homesteads / Research Stations
*   **Location:** Scattered across the ice sheet.
*   **Function:** Independent family units focusing on specialized research (genetics, marine biology) or resource harvesting. Connected by high-speed pneumatic tube trains running through the ice.

## Flora & Fauna

*   **Native Life:** Simple aquatic life forms (crustaceans, jellies) near thermal vents.
*   **Engineered Life:**
    *   *Frost-Kelp:* Genetically modified algae growing on the underside of the ice, harvesting dim light and releasing oxygen.
    *   *Aquatic Livestock:* Large, blubber-rich fish stocks introduced for food.

## Resources & Economy

*   **Major Exports:**
    *   **Water:** The primary export to Samūm and the Belt.
    *   **Biotechnology:** Medical breakthroughs and genetic engineering data.
    *   **Methane:** Fuel for ships and reactors.
*   **Strategic Importance:** The control of the Space Elevator ("The Beanstalk") gives Ísreikistjarna massive leverage in system trade.
