# Amir Khalid Al-Sahra'i
Name: Amir Khalid Al-Sahra'i. 
Background: Khalid is a young prince, a favored son of the second brother of the King. He controls significant political and economic resources in the Combs. His family’s power is tied to their control over the mining industry and solar power production - they wield significant political influence within the Combs' monarchy.
Personality: Arrogant and entitled, Khalid has grown up in luxury, but is ruthless and cunning. Despite his lack of experience, he has a sharp eye for business potential-and a jealous streak, driving him to attempt to exert control Najm al-Majd.
Motivation: Khalid feels overshadowed by his father and his father's two brothers, especially the king.  He seeks to prove himself and to regain the old power of the royal family by expanding his influence in the Combs, even if it means disregarding his father's and uncles' instruction. His ambition is fueled by a desire to outshine his family and be seen as a powerful leader in his own right, possibly seeing himself as a potential replacement for the king one day, who he sees as weak.
Flaws: His arrogance blinds him to the needs and struggles of the common people, making him a polarizing figure. His reliance on inherited power rather than earned respect could lead to his downfall.
Conflict with Asef: Khalid might see Asef as both a threat and a tool. He will attempt to gain control of and manipulate Asef’s company to further his own ends, underestimating Asef’s integrity and the loyalty of his workers and other backers.

Dual Motives: Khalid might publicly justify his actions as being for the "good of the Combs" or the "restoration of the royal family’s proper place." This would make him seem less like a simple power-grabber and more of a misguided leader with some genuine, if warped, vision. This could humanize him, showing that while he’s ruthless, he believes he's acting in the best interest of the planet.

Personal Vulnerabilities: Consider giving him moments of doubt or insecurity, particularly regarding his family. He could have a complicated relationship with his father, who perhaps disregards him in favor of Khalid's siblings, motivating his need to prove himself.

Attempts to Manipulate: Khalid might try to coerce Asef into making decisions that favor his goals, perhaps subtly at first, offering bribes or appealing to the royal family’s past association with Najm al-Majd. When Asef resists, Khalid’s approach could become more aggressive.

Ultimately, Khalid attempts to subvert Asef's integrity by offering him the ticket to what his son wants most -- to attend the space pilot academy. The royal family is able to stronly influence who recieves these coveted slots. When Maxim realizes that Khalid's offer means that he would have leverage over his father's integrity, he makes the difficult decision to pass on the nomination to his friend, Janer. Unknown to him, Maxim was also recommended on his own merits of being a kind and passionate member of the community by Aimee and ends up getting a scholarship anyway. Unable to say that Asef "owes him" for his son's attendance at the space pilot academy, Khalid's sway over Najim al Majid decreases, leaving him to lick his wounds and plot other revenge. Meanwhile, the palace  counsel feels that it can't retract the offer to Janer, but needs to save face by having another "royal family sponsorship". They choose to send Layla, the King's daugter.

Vision for the Royal Family: Khalid might want to centralize control again, believing the royal family should have more direct oversight over commerce and industry in the Combs, seeing the current King (his uncle) as too lenient or weak. This could put him in ideological opposition to both Asef and the King’s other family members, adding complexity to his motivations.

Overconfidence: His jealousy and desire to outshine the King might lead him to overestimate his abilities and underestimate the importance of loyal workers, making him a more tragic figure as he potentially overreaches.

Interaction with the King's Brothers:
Internal Family Conflict: Perhaps Khalid’s father sees his son as a liability or disagrees with his methods, adding tension between them. This could heighten Khalid’s need to assert himself outside the shadow of his father and uncles.

Public Perception:
Two-Faced Persona: Publicly, Khalid could present himself as a reformer or a visionary, masking his ruthless ambition behind a veneer of royal responsibility. Privately, however, he’s willing to resort to underhanded tactics.

Flaws and Conflict:
Hubris: Khalid's overconfidence and lack of respect for the common people make him vulnerable. He might disregard advice from more experienced allies, creating internal conflicts and potential betrayal within his own faction.

Khalid's father doesn't disagree with the purpose of Khalid, just fears that the King will step in, even possibly removing him if Khalid oversteps too far. Nevertheless Khalid's father is very powerful, and would gladly use that power to assert control of Najm al-Majid if he could.

# King’s Brothers and Khalid’s Family Dossier:
## 1. Prince Omar Al-Sahra'i (Khalid’s Father)
Position: Oldest brother of the King, father of Khalid.

Control: Oversees the mining industry, including deep-core and surface extraction, as well as contracts for solar power production on the surface for use in the Combs and at the Spaceport.

Personality: Calculating, pragmatic, and power-hungry, Omar is driven by maintaining and expanding the influence of the royal family. Unlike his son Khalid, he is more patient and cautious. Omar understands the delicate political balance in the Combs and fears Khalid's impulsive actions might provoke the King to intervene.

Relationship with Khalid: While Omar shares Khalid's ambition for control over Najm al-Majd and expanding royal influence, he is wary of Khalid overreaching too quickly. He is supportive but cautious, keeping a close watch on Khalid’s actions, using his own power to nudge decisions in his favor without drawing too much attention.


## 2. Prince Faris Al-Sahra'i
Position: Second royal brother (the King is youngest).

Control: Faris is the instigator of the "49.9% plot". While the royal family is limited by treaty to "less than 50%" interest in any company in most critical sectors; he has managed to amass a hairs-breath-from-majority stake in several key sectors, especially the production means of technology and communications infrastructure in the Combs. Personal connections and under-the-table favors to key allies manage to give him a controlling power in several companies, which he uses shrewdly to increase his personal wealth and power.

Personality: Charismatic, suave, and more public-facing than Omar. Faris is the type who prefers to charm and manipulate rather than rely on brute force or intimidation. He is skilled at forming alliances and keeping up appearances, often seen as the most approachable member of the royal family. He is shrewd in business dealings and can often spin a deal to his advantage without the other party even realizing it.

Relationship with Khalid: Faris considers Khalid to be his protege; more so than Khalid's own father. He recognizes the potential in Khalid's ambitions if channeled correctly. Faris, however, stays at arm’s length from Khalid publically, preferring to work behind the scenes and let Khalid take the fall if he makes a misstep.

Flaws: Faris’s charm can come across as insincere to those who know him well, and his tendency to overextend his network of alliances could leave him vulnerable if one of his schemes were to fail. He is also seen as disconnected from the real struggles of the Combs' citizens, focusing more on his financial empire.


# King Taymus
* King Tamus is youngest of the three brothers.
* King Taymus's tolerance of his brothers’ behavior stems from a combination of pragmatism, concern for stability, and his limitations under the Treaty of Quoath. Furthermore his wife (a nuudelchid commoner), has helped him have a heart change, being more compassionate towards the people of the Combs and even (somewhat limited) towards surface dwellers. Thanks to her influence, he believes that his best option is to live a good example and limit the damage his brothers can do rather than confronting them head-on, especially if their actions are not particularly egrigious. There is always the possibility they could oust him if they felt that he was a bigger threat to their power than each other. The main thing that has kept them from ousting him in the past is that they would have to agree between themselves which would be the new king - and neither of the older brothers trusts the other. 

Fear of Civil Chaos: Taymus knows that openly opposing his brothers would likely destabilize the political and economic balance of the Combs. His brothers control critical sectors like mining, power, manufacturing, and logistics, and moving against them could risk disrupting these industries if they were to flex their control to cause trouble for the community.

Treaty of Quoath: The Treaty itself limits Taymus’s direct control over interplanetary trade. While his brothers operate just within the confines of the treaty, exercising control through their 49.9% ownership stakes, they are not technically violating the treaty overtly. Calling on enforcement of the the treaty would make it difficult for him to do so without ceding more control to the interplanetary counsel.  Since his brothers technically exploit loopholes in the treaty, Taymus is left with few options to directly challenge them without triggering political fallout.

Focus on the People: Taymus has chosen to focus on public welfare while allowing his brothers to handle the logistic and economic side of the Combs. He may believe that his role as king is better suited to ensuring the wellbeing of the citizens, leaving the more mercantile affairs to his brothers.

Caring Nature: Taymus genuinely cares for the wellbeing of the Combs' citizens and his family. While he might not like how his brothers operate, he believes believe that keeping the peace within the royal family is more important than launching into a political battle that could weaken the monarchy and, by extension, harm the Combs.

Pragmatic Leadership: Taymus is aware of his limited power to challenge his brothers outright without causing widespread economic and political disruption. Instead of fighting them, he has accepted the role of balancing their ambitions with the greater good of the people, even if it means tolerating behavior he disagrees with.

Taymus understands the extent of his brothers' ambitions but chooses to navigate around them carefully. Over the years, he has realized that a direct confrontation with Omar and Faris would cause more harm than good, especially given their control over key industries. He is aware that his brothers seek greater influence and power, particularly Sardar, but sees no way to oppose them without risking civil discord or economic collapse.

Calculated Tolerance: Taymus knows full well that his brothers are pushing the limits of the Treaty of Quoath and are focused on increasing their power. He tolerates their behavior as a necessary evil, opting to focus on sectors where he can make a tangible difference (e.g., public services, infrastructure, select, upright individuals and their companies that have sought alliances with him) without igniting a conflict within the family or the city.

Taymus also sees family unity as a way to maintain overall stability within the Combs. While he may privately disapprove of his brothers' actions, he understands that an open conflict within the royal family would undermine their collective authority and weaken the monarchy.
