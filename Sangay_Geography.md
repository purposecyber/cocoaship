# Sangay: The Smoking Emerald

**Planet Type:** Volcanic Jungle Moon
**System Position:** Inner Moon of the Gas Giant
**Orbital Distance:** ~0.9 million km from Gas Giant (Closer than Ísreikistjarna)
**Satellites:** None

## Planetary Statistics

*   **Gravity:** 0.9g
*   **Diameter:** ~12,500 km
*   **Day Length:** Tidally Locked to Gas Giant (Permanent day/night sides relative to the primary, but rotating relative to the sun with the Gas Giant's orbit).
*   **Tidal Forces:** Extreme. The gravitational tug-of-war between the Gas Giant and Ísreikistjarna keeps Sangay's core molten and active.

## Atmosphere & Climate

*   **Pressure:** 2.0 - 4.0 Bar (depending on altitude)
*   **Composition:**
    *   CO2: High
    *   Sulfur Dioxide: High
    *   Water Vapor: Very High
    *   Oxygen: Moderate (produced by massive plant growth, but overwhelmed by volcanic gases).
*   **Habitability:**
    *   **Lowlands:** Toxic "Killing Fields." High pressure, acidic air, extreme heat.
    *   **Highlands (The Cloud Forests):** Habitable with assistance (respirators). Air is thinner and cooler.
*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Global Average:** 30°C to 50°C.
    *   **Volcanic Zones:** >100°C.

## Geography & Geology

Sangay is the most geologically violent body in the system. It is a world of fire and life.

### Surface Features
*   **The Ring of Fire:** A chain of massive volcanoes along the tidal bulge.
    *   *Montaña de Fuego:* The largest peak, piercing the cloud layer. Its slopes host the primary human settlements.
*   **The Verdant Oceans:** Not water, but unending waves of jungle canopy covering the mid-latitudes.
*   **The Steam Lakes:** High-altitude caldera lakes heated by magma, source of the planet's freshwater and industrial steam power.

## Flora & Fauna

Life on Sangay is hyper-evolutionary, competing for space and sunlight in a nutrient-rich, high-energy environment.

### Flora
*   **Gigantism:** Plants grow to massive sizes. Trees are kilometers tall in the deep valleys.
*   **Crops:** The "Breadbasket" of the system.
    *   *Sangay Coffee:* High-caffeine, rich flavor, mutated by volcanic soil.
    *   *Star-Cocoa:* A staple luxury export.
    *   *Tropical Fruits:* Bananas, mangos, papayas, dragonfruit grow in abundance with year-round harvests.

### Fauna
*   **Dangerous Wildlife:** Adaptation to a hostile world has created predators with chitinous armor and acid resistance.
*   **Harvesters:** Robotic drones are the primary "fauna" encountered in the agricultural zones, maintaining the farms where humans cannot safely tread.

## Human Habitation

Population is small (~10,000), primarily Nüüdelchid clans who prefer the isolation and the challenge.

*   **The Haciendas:** Domed, pressurized estates built on high mountain ridges.
*   **Lifestyle:** Agricultural barons and researchers. They live in luxury surrounded by danger.
*   **Protection:** Settlements are shielded by "Thunder Domes" to protect against volcanic debris and acid rain.

## Resources & Economy

*   **Major Exports:**
    *   **Food:** Supplies 80% of the fresh produce for the Mingusat system (Samūm, Ísreikistjarna, Belt).
    *   **Coffee & Cocoa:** The backbone of the luxury trade (e.g., The Cocoa Ship).
*   **Technological Marvel: The Steam Catapults**
    *   *Function:* Due to the high gravity and thick atmosphere, traditional rocket launches are expensive. Sangay uses massive, geothermal steam-powered mass drivers (catapults) built into volcano slopes to launch armored cargo canisters into orbit.
    *   *Logistics:* Cargo is caught in orbit by Nüüdelchid tugs and transferred to freighters like the *Cocoa Ship*.
