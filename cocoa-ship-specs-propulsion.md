# Cocoa Ship Specifications & Propulsion

## Propulsion Systems
The ship utilizes a hybrid system to balance efficiency with thrust.
*   **Primary Propulsion (Long-Range):** **Solar Sails**
    *   **Size:** Massive, highly reflective sails covering ~33 square kilometers (approx. 13 sq miles) when fully extended.
    *   **Function:** Captures photon pressure for continuous, low-thrust acceleration without fuel consumption. ideal for the long transits between Mingusat's planets.
    *   **Operation:** Sails are adjusted manually or via mechanical rigging to optimize angle of incidence.

*   **Secondary Propulsion (High-Thrust/Maneuvering):** **Fusion Drive**
    *   **Type:** Onboard Fusion Drive (Deuterium-Tritium).
    *   **Function:** Provides high-thrust burns for initial acceleration, orbital insertion, gravity assists, and course corrections when solar pressure is insufficient (e.g., near the asteroid belt).
    *   **Performance:** Capable of exhaust velocities around 0.1c, but used sparingly due to fuel conservation needs.

## Fuel & Power Generation
The ship features a self-sustaining "breeder" system to generate fuel for the fusion drive and life support.

### Water-Lithium Breeder System
*   **Concept:** A regenerative loop that utilizes water and lithium blankets around the fusion core.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Deuterium Source:** Water (H2O) is split via electrolysis. Deuterium is separated from hydrogen for fuel. Oxygen is used for life support.
    2.  **Tritium Breeding:** A lithium blanket surrounding the reactor captures neutrons from the fusion reaction, breeding Tritium (essential for D-T fusion).
    3.  **Shielding:** The lithium/water layers act as effective radiation shielding for the crew.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Fuel:** Deuterium and Tritium.
    *   **Life Support:** Oxygen.
    *   **Propellant:** Excess non-heavy hydrogen used as reaction mass.

## Maintenance & Auxiliary Systems
*   **Drones:**
    *   **Exterior:** Autonomous drones maintain the hull and the vast expanse of the solar sails, repairing micrometeoroid damage.
    *   **Orion's Role:** Orion frequently repairs and reprograms these drones.
*   **Hydroponics:**
    *   **Function:** Supplemental food source and air filtration.
    *   **Integration:** Fed by composted waste from the cocoa/coffee processing and wastewater recycling.
    *   **Ecosystem:** Includes a small aquarium with fish from Ísreikistjarna, creating a aquaponic loop.
*   **Water Recycling:**
    *   **Efficiency:** Near 100% closed-loop system, critical for the breeder reactor and life support.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Low-Tech/Analog:** Intentional reliance on mechanical, hydraulic, and steam-powered systems over complex microelectronics.
    *   *Reasoning:* Computer chips are difficult to manufacture in space; mechanical systems are easier to repair with onboard tools and scrap.
    *   *Examples:* Manual levers for sail rigging, steam-heated drying racks, analog gauges in the cockpit.
