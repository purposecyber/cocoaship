# The Cocoa Ship (Cocoa-04-c5d7-7B)

## Profile
*   **Type:** Small to medium-sized interplanetary cargo freighter.
*   **Ownership:** Starling Family: Rigel Ziri Starling (Samūm native) and Aurora Aiyana Ivanova-Starling (Nüüdelchid), Orion Ezio Starling (their son).
*   **Significance:** A family-run vessel that serves as Orion's home, school, and the foundation of his technical and piloting expertise.

## Route & Mission
*   **Primary Cargo:** Agricultural produce, specifically coffee beans and cacao beans, along with fruits and vegetables.
*   **Route Circuit:**
    1.  **Sangay:** Pickup of raw produce (coffee beans, cacao beans, tropical fruits).
    2.  **Ísreikistjarna:** Refueling, selling produce, pickup of fish/water (sometimes).
    3.  **The Wayfarer (Nüüdelchid Station):** Resupply, produce sales.
    4.  **Samum:** Final stop, sales of remaining goods. (Often including servicing and refit while visiting Rigel’s family.)
*   **Unique Value Proposition:** The ship processes (ferments and dries) its cacao bean cargo into cocoa powder (hence the nickname "Cocoa Ship"), roasted coffee beans and dehydrated fruits *en route*, delivering higher-value, ready-to-use or rehydrate goods upon arrival.

## Onboard Processing
The ship utilizes the long transit times (weeks between planets) to add value to its cargo.
*   **Fermentation:** Done in large vats within the temperature-controlled gravity ring. 
*   **Drying:** Beans are spread on racks in a warm, dry section of the ring, often heated by solar energy or steam systems.
*   **Waste Management:** Pulp and husks are repurposed as compost for the ship's hydroponics or biomass energy.
*   **Atmosphere:** The processing areas smell earthily of fermentation and roasting beans, a scent that permeates the ship and defines Orion's childhood.

## Ship Layout
The ship is a custom-refitted, older vessel with a "lived-in," industrial aesthetic. It relies on low-tech, rugged mechanical systems rather than advanced digital automation where possible.

### 1. Rotating Gravity Ring
*   **Function:** Provides .85g artificial gravity via centripetal force. Houses living quarters and processing facilities.
*   **Living Quarters:** Modest family space with a kitchen/communal area. Orion’s room is small, cluttered with projects, featuring a viewport.
*   **Processing Areas:** Fermentation vats and drying racks line the walls. The air is humid and aromatic.

### 2. Engine Room (Zero-G / Low-G)
*   **Location:** Below the gravity ring, accessible via a central shaft.
*   **Contents:** Fusion drive core, solar sail control rigging, mechanic's workspace.
*   **Atmosphere:** Functional, filled with the hum of the reactor and the clinking of sail rigging.

### 3. Cargo Holds
*   **Climate Controlled:** Specialized bays for keeping raw and finished produce at optimal temperatures.
*   **Equipment:** Nets, straps, and hand-operated cranes. No wasted space.

### 4. Cockpit/Bridge
*   **Style:** Analog and mechanical. Physical levers, switches, and worn pilot seats.
*   **View:** Unparalleled views of the cosmos, framed by the massive solar sails.

## Crew & Life Aboard
*   **Permanent Crew:** Rigel (Captain), Aurora (Co-pilot/Processing Lead), Orion (Apprentice/Jack-of-all-trades).
*   **Additional Crew:** 4-6 hired hands for processing and shift coverage (Technicians, Engineer, Deckhand).
*   **Shifts:** Two-shift rotation during long hauls.
*   **Food:** The ship is self-sustaining, with a hydroponics system and a small aquaponic aquarium. Extracted water and waste biomass are recycled into the hydro/aquaponic system as food and fertilizer. The crew also has access to fresh produce from the cargo holds. During refit, the ship takes on fresh produce for consumption from local markets, as well as dried and processed goods which can be stored in the non-temperature controlled cargo holds.
*   **Crew Roles:**
    *   **Engineering:** Repairing customized low-tech systems, drones, and the fusion drive's water-breeder interface. The Cocoa Ship has several small drones used for monitoring cargo, making repairs, and helping with general maintenance tasks.
    *   **Processing:** Expert in the fermentation/drying lifecycles of cocoa and coffee.
    *   **Piloting/Navigation:** Learned astrogation and manual solar sail adjustment from his father.
    *   **Adaptability:** Comfortable in zero-G, high-G (Samum), and diverse planetary environments.
    *   **Companion:** Finds friendship with a pet penguin from Ísreikistjarna.
