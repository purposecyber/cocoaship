Want to work on the physics of space launch on Samum. I want ascent and descent to be by special purpose tugs with giant wings. They use some sort of projected power from the surface. Explain some ideas
ChatGPT said:
Start with the constraint: you want big winged tugs that handle ascent/descent, and most of the “oomph” comes from the ground, not from chemical rockets on the vehicle.

Think of it as:

Orbital layer: vehicles that never touch atmosphere.

Tug layer: giant-wing “ferries” that go surface ↔ low orbit, powered mostly by projected energy from Samūm’s surface.

Below are a few distinct architectures you can pick from or hybridize.

1. Microwave / Laser Power-Beamed Turbojet → Scramjet Tug
Concept: The tug is basically a flying power receiver. It has giant wings covered in rectennas (for microwaves) or high-efficiency PV / tuned absorbers (for lasers). The surface beams continuous power to the tug, which uses that power to run air-breathing engines during ascent and fan/brake systems during descent.

Ascent profile (sketch)
Takeoff / low altitude:

Ground station locks a microwave beam onto the tug.

The wings and maybe underside are a rectenna mesh.

Power feeds high-bypass electric turbofans. It looks like an absurdly overpowered electric airliner with sailplane wings.

Transonic to hypersonic:

As air thins, engines transition from turbojet/turbofan → ramjet → scramjet.

All compressor work and fuel heating is from beamed power, so the tug carries little or no onboard chemical fuel, maybe just a small reserve.

Upper atmosphere / edge of space:

Past where ram/scram doesn’t work, the tug fires a small beamed-power rocket stage (could be laser-thermal; see next section), or couples to a magnetic tether from an orbital vehicle.

Target is low orbital velocity or a “hand-off” speed/altitude to the orbital tug.

Descent profile
Deorbit from orbital tug:

Orbital tug drops the atmospheric tug onto a steep suborbital trajectory.

As soon as it dips into upper atmosphere, surface stations reacquire it with beams.

Beamed-power braking:

Beamed power runs electric fans / magnetically driven compressors that ram more air over the wings, letting the vehicle fly a high-lift, high-drag profile, shedding speed quickly without insane heating.

Alternatively, the beam powers plasma actuators on the leading edges, deliberately thickening/shaping the shock layer to manage heating and lift.

Final approach:

At low speed, it just behaves like a huge electric glider with ridiculous power, able to hover-ish around the spaceport and land precisely.

Why it fits Samūm
Desert = huge solar arrays driving microwave/laser emitters.

Combs and solar tower complexes make sense as the ground infrastructure.

Very visual: glowing beam columns tracking a hypersonic glider.

2. Laser-Thermal / Microwave-Thermal “Hot Air” Tug
This is more aggressive: the beam doesn’t just give electricity; it directly heats propellant.

Core idea:
You beam power from the ground into a heat exchanger inside the tug. The tug takes in air (or a carried working fluid like hydrogen), runs it through the exchanger, and throws it out the back as hot plasma. The giant wings give lift; the hot exhaust gives thrust.

Ascent
Low altitude:

Tugs suck in atmospheric air, run it across blackbody or photonic crystal “cups” inside the engine, heated by a laser/microwave beam.

Exhaust is very hot but no onboard combustion needed.

Mid/upper atmosphere:

Air gets thin; the tug transitions to stored reaction mass (a lightweight tank of hydrogen/ammonia/water).

Beam keeps heating; mass throughput drops, but exhaust velocity increases, so you still have thrust.

Orbit insertion:

With enough beam intensity, you can push it nearly all the way to orbital velocity.

Alternatively, you only need to reach a high-apoapsis suborbital and let an orbital tug finish the circularization.

Descent
You can reverse the idea: during reentry, the beam powers active cooling (pumping a coolant layer under the skin) and small “reverse” thrusters for final slowdown.

In normal ops, most of descent is just gliding on those giant wings; the beam only kicks in for high-precision maneuvers or emergency braking.

Narrative levers
Risk of “overcooking” the exchanger: you can have dramatic failures if a tug leaves the beam spot.

Political control: whoever controls the beam stations controls access to orbit.

3. Plasma “Rail Wire” + Winged Kites
This leans into “projected power” more literally: you project a conductive path into the atmosphere.

Picture: On launch, ground stations fire ionizing lasers or microwave beams to create a vertical plasma filament (or a ladder of filaments). The tug deploys conductive “hooks” that ride these filaments like a trolley on invisible power lines.

Mechanism
Ground end: huge power station pushes high-frequency current into the plasma column.

Tug end: wingtip structures and a dorsal fin act as pickup shoes, drawing enormous current to run superconducting coils / electric thrusters.

The wings give lift; the plasma wire gives both power and some electromagnetic support (you can push against the column magnetically, getting lift+thrust without reaction mass).

Ascent
Tug takes off conventionally and climbs into the lower end of the plasma column.

Once “latched”, the ground station ramps power; the tug climbs this corridor with minimal onboard power, its wings stabilizing and steering.

Near the top, it transitions to free-flight and then to rendezvous with orbital infrastructure.

Descent
Inverse: a returning tug intercepts the plasma corridor, latches on, and uses it as a powered, actively controlled glide-path, bleeding off speed via EM braking while the corridor acts as a giant dynamic arrestor cable.

Why it’s fun
Visually: at night, ascents look like forked lightning columns with a glider surfing them.

Plot-wise: corridors can be disrupted by storms, sabotage, power shortages. Access to orbit literally depends on keeping these “light rails” open.

4. Beamed-Power Maglev Launch Rail + Winged Catcher
Here the projected power is mostly used on the ground, and the wings are about making the handoff to the sky.

Ascent
Samūm has a maglev launch rail built into a canyon or along a plateau near a Comb.

Tugs are essentially winged sleds. The launch rail:

Receives power from ground solar/microwave plants.

Throws the tug to Mach 5–7 at high altitude (end of rail is on a tall tower / mountain).

Once airborne, the tug transitions to beamed-power air-breathing engines (as in #1) to finish the climb to the handoff point.

Descent
Incoming orbital tug drops the atmospheric tug onto a trajectory that intersects the upper end of the launch rail’s flight corridor.

The tug dives, then uses beamed power for precise control and a magnetic catcher at the far end of the rail to scrub the remaining kinetic energy.

You’d have huge recovery coils that feed power back into the grid when tugs land.

World implications
The rail is a strategic asset: fixed, targetable, heavily defended.

Redundancy forces multiple rails in different combs/cities, which can be a plot element.

5. Descent-First Design: Beamed Power for Hypersonic Lift & Cooling
Even if you pick any of the above for ascent, descent can get its own flavor.

Concept: reentry tugs with giant wings that lean on active, beamed-powered cooling and lift so they can reenter steeply over a small footprint.

Leading edges contain micro-channels with coolant that is pumped and re-cooled using beamed power, so you can tolerate insane heat loads.

Wings use plasma actuators powered by ground beams to dynamically shape the shock and lift distribution mid-flight.

From the ground, descent looks like a glowing streak that suddenly blooms into a high-aspect glider, circling down over the Combs, with visible beam lines converging on it.

This makes Samūm’s airspace highly quantized: reentry happens in narrow, controlled corridors that require synchronized ground power.

Choosing a “Main Canon”
If you want a single primary system that feels Samūm-ish:

Primary canon:

Microwave/laser beamed power to winged air-breathing tugs (#1)

With descent using beamed-powered active cooling and plasma lift (#5)

Secondary / experimental systems:

A prototype plasma rail wire launcher (#3) in one comb.

An older maglev rail from the war/treaty era (#4), now mostly used for cargo.

That gives you:

Big visible infrastructure on the surface (power towers, beam arrays, launch corridors).

Distinct failure modes and plot hooks (beam outage, misalignment, corridor sabotage).

A clear separation between orbital traffic and atmospheric tugs, which fits your broader “tugs and stations” aesthetic.

If you want, next pass we can:

Pick one architecture as canon and

Work out numbers (altitude bands, typical speeds, power levels) and what a launch looks like minute-by-minute from the ground and from inside the tug.

Why does Samum need solar in an age of practical fusion
ChatGPT said:
Three clean reasons, each tied to Samūm’s physical environment and its political history—not “fusion bad,” but “fusion not the right tool for these jobs.”

1. Solar = distributed, fusion = centralized
Fusion on Samūm is practical, but high-power beam launch infrastructure and atmospheric tug operations need geographically distributed terawatt-scale surface power.

Fusion gives you very dense, stationary generation.
The beamed-power ascent/descent system wants:

multiple emitters spread across many kilometers

wide-area redundancy (storms, dust veils, power routing)

instantaneous load control

power shaping (e.g., steering microwaves/lasers, cycling rail segments)

Solar arrays—covering canyon ridges, plateau edges, and the upper shells of the Combs—scale horizontally at essentially zero marginal cost. Fusion plants cannot do that; they produce concentrated power you still have to move.

High-power transmission on Samūm is brittle: long lines across dry canyons get sandblasted, insulators arc, and the planet’s frequent electrostatic storms degrade conductors.
Solar turns this into local production → local use, minimizing transmission distance.

So in orbital-access terms:

Fusion runs the grid.

Solar feeds the launch tugs directly, where they sit.

It’s the same logic as having solar on Earth even if fusion came tomorrow.

2. Fusion is infrastructure; solar is terrain
Samūm’s terrain—wide, dry, high-altitude desert plateaus—makes solar absurdly efficient:

Low humidity → low atmospheric absorption

Dusty but predictable (scheduled wash cycles, electrostatic dust-shedding films)

High solar constant and latitude bands with > 300 clear days a year

Cold nights → efficient PV thermal cycling if managed properly

Solar isn’t a fallback—it’s the planet’s natural resource.
They don’t choose solar because fusion is insufficient. They choose solar because the planet is effectively a star-facing energy farm.

Fusion complements it, but you don’t give up a free, planet-scale energy resource just because a compact one exists.

3. Geopolitical control and treaty constraints
The treaty after the Samūm conflict created formal restrictions on:

fusion-based weapons platforms

fusion-driven propulsion inside the atmosphere

mobile fusion reactors within certain proximity of population centers

fusion-powered orbital launchers (seen as dual-use for kinetic bombardment)

The result is that:

Fusion is for cities, water cracking, heavy industry, and deep-underground infrastructure.

Solar is for anything that can be dual-use if militarized.

Beamed-power launch infrastructure, because it can impart lethal energy at long range, is explicitly required to run on transparent, surface-visible energy sources (solar, wind-tower kinetic harvesters, thermal gradients).

That political constraint alone forces launch infrastructure to be non-fusion:
if Samūm’s ascent/descent beam stations were powered directly by reactors, they’d violate treaty articles that forbid untraceable high-energy projection systems.

Solar makes beamed power observable, accountable, and throttled by easy-to-monitor generation capacity.

4. Environmental & safety factors unique to Samūm
Fusion on a desert world is safe but not clean in every sense:

Neutron flux issues on Samūm’s thin crust cause material degradation faster than on Earth.

Maintaining containment under frequent seismic micro-tremors (Samūm is tectonically active at shallow depths) raises reactor cost and risk.

The planet’s dry atmosphere makes tritium-handling strict; even harmless atmospheric releases travel far and remain unbound longer.

So reactors exist—plenty of them—but nobody builds more than they need.
Surface-level “throwaway” gigawatt loads (like beam launchers) are simply cheaper to do with solar.

5. Economics: fusion is capital-limited, solar is area-limited
Samūm’s economy is area-rich, capital-poor.
The Combs invested early in:

high-tech PV

solar thermal towers

lightweight rectenna sheets

self-cleaning desert solar carpets

integrated powertextures on cliff faces

All of these scale by simply laying down more material.
Fusion plants scale by spending more fusion-grade material, shielding, and complex engineering talent.

When the bottleneck is skilled labor and rare materials—not land—solar wins by default.

Synthesis
Samūm uses fusion exactly where it is best:

deep infrastructure

high-density industrial loads

nighttime baseload

underground fabrication

water cracking, mining, refining

orbital arcology power

Samūm uses solar where planetary features and political constraints demand:

surface-to-orbit tugs

beam launch stations

desert habitation arrays

microgrids within each Comb

all distributed systems where energy transparency matters

The planet isn’t choosing between solar and fusion.
It’s choosing the right energy architecture for its geography, treaty system, and launch physics.

If you want, next step is dialing exactly how much beam power a tug needs, and how big the solar fields feeding a launch station have to be.

You said:
Compare production capacity solar to fusion on samum
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clean, quantitative comparison of production capacity for solar vs. fusion on Samūm, based on its environment and the political/engineering constraints you’ve set. The numbers aren’t meant as final canon, but they give you realistic order-of-magnitude behavior so that the two systems feel grounded and distinct.

I’ll walk through the derivation so you can adjust any parameter.

1. Baseline Environmental Parameters for Samūm
We need two assumptions first:

A. Samūm receives slightly more stellar flux than Earth
If Samūm is a hot, dry desert world with intense sun, assume:

Solar constant: ~1.3–1.4 kW/m² (Earth = 1.36 kW/m² top-of-atmosphere)

Atmospheric transmission: ~80–85% (drier → less scattering)

Surface average ~1.0–1.1 kW/m² noon peak.

B. Samūm has enormous usable flat area
The desert plateaus around the Combs give:

tens of thousands of km² per population hub

trivial shading

long-term stable geology

Solar is naturally scale-friendly.

2. Solar Production Capacity on Samūm
Break into three levels: theoretical, realistic, and planetary infrastructure capacity.

(A) Maximum theoretical solar output (just physics)
At ~1.1 kW/m² noon and ~30% PV efficiency (mid-future plausible):

Peak delivered power:
0.30 × 1100 W/m² ≈ 330 W/m²

Per square kilometer:

330 MW/km²

0.33 GW/km²

This is the hard physics upper bound.

(B) Infrastructure-realistic build assuming Samūm tech
You can’t blanket every meter; real arrays need spacing, inverters, access, anti-dust systems, thermal management, rectenna overlays, etc.

Assume 45–55% land coverage and system efficiency ~25%:

Effective ~250 W/m²
→ 250 MW/km²

A city-scale solar field of 100 km² produces:

25 gigawatts, daytime.

A dedicated launch station field of 200–300 km²:

50–75 GW daytime.

Note the key feature:
Samūm can cheaply and practically lay down hundreds of km² of panels around each Comb, so raw capacity scales linearly with area—no rare materials, no high-skill bottleneck.

(C) Planetary operational capacity
If three major Combs each maintain:

500–1000 km² solar infrastructure

Then planetary solar production is:

250–500 GW per Comb

750–1500 GW total (0.75–1.5 terawatts)

This is baseload daytime capacity before storage or thermal reservoirs.

3. Fusion Production Capacity on Samūm
Treat fusion as concentrated, capital-intensive, and limited by shielding, workforce, and treaty constraints.

(A) Per-reactor output
Mid-future compact fusion plant might produce:

3–10 GW per reactor containment

Requires heavy shielding and deep foundations (Samūm has thin crust and seismic jitter → deeper placement)

(B) Reactor cluster size
A single installation realistically hosts:

3–6 reactors (siting, cooling, seismic constraints)

So a full fusion facility = 15–50 GW.

(C) Fusion distribution by population center
Treat Samūm’s treaty-era infrastructure as:

One major fusion facility per Comb

Maybe a regional industrial facility on each of a few plateaus

Ballpark:

3 Combs × 20–40 GW each = 60–120 GW

2–3 industrial clusters × 15–25 GW = 30–75 GW

Planetary fusion total:

~100–200 GW

This is an order of magnitude lower than solar potential.

Why?
Fusion is:

capital bounded (reactor-grade materials are rare)

politically bounded (treaty restrictions on atmospheric proximity & mobile fusion)

physically bounded (shielding + seismic problems)

labor bounded (few people can maintain containment systems)

Solar is:

area bounded

materials light

low-skill scalable

safe to deploy directly next to cities and launch stations

4. Head-to-Head Capacity Comparison
Metric	Solar	Fusion
Scalability limit	Land area	Skilled people, heavy materials
Peak output per km² / unit	0.25–0.33 GW/km²	3–10 GW per reactor
Total per Comb (realistic)	250–500 GW	20–40 GW
Planetwide (3–4 Combs)	750–1500 GW	100–200 GW
Response time	Fast (minutes)	Slow (hours)
Spatial distribution	Highly distributed	Highly centralized
Best use	Beamed power, tugs, microgrids	Industry, baseload
Overall: solar provides ~5–10× more usable power than fusion on Samūm, because Samūm has nearly unlimited high-quality solar real estate but strong political & engineering limitations on expanding the reactor fleet.

This is exactly the opposite of Earth’s constraints, which is why it feels fresh and plausible.

5. Narrative Implications
This gives you clean world logic:

A. Why tugs run on beamed solar power
Because solar has far more instantaneous peak capacity, and the launch tugs need huge pulses of power (tens of gigawatts) over short windows.

B. Why Combs bristle with solar towers & panel farms
It’s not a symbolic design choice—it’s their competitive industrial strategy.

C. Why fusion exists but doesn’t dominate orbit access
Fusion is indispensable but too rare, too centralized, and too politically constrained to power everything.

D. Why Samūm cares about weather, dust veils, storm fronts
Even a solar-rich world has to manage intermittency → operational constraints on launches.

If you want next:
I can quantify exact power per launch, beam station layout, and panel area per tug so you can set canon that feels physically rigorous.

You said:
Ok I think that works. But limit might be lack of water on Samum?
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, if there’s a “real” hard cap on Samūm’s energy system, it’s almost certainly water, not sunlight or fusion physics.

Let me break it into pieces and compare where water bites solar vs fusion vs launch.

1. Where the water actually goes
On Samūm you’ve basically got four big buckets of water demand:

Life support / agriculture – people, food, limited greenery.

Industry – fabrication, mining, chemistry.

Power systems – cooling, cleaning, working fluids.

Launch system – reaction mass (hydrogen, water, ammonia), tug cooling.

You can decide where the real choke point is by which of those is hardest to expand.

2. Solar’s water footprint
2.1 Cooling
For plain PV / rectenna fields:

They don’t need water for cooling.

You run them a bit hot, take an efficiency hit (say 2–5 percentage points), and call it a day.

If you do cool, you can use:

closed-loop fluids (oil, supercritical CO₂) with radiators, not evaporative towers

night-side radiative cooling surfaces

So on Samūm: solar doesn’t have to be a cooling water hog.

2.2 Cleaning
Here is where water starts to matter.

Order-of-magnitude:

Cleaning a dusty panel might take ~0.2–1 L/m² if you just spray and squeegee.

1 km² = 1,000,000 m² → 0.2–1 million liters per cleaning.

1000 km² of arrays → 0.2–1 billion liters per cleaning (10⁵–10⁶ m³).

That’s brutal if you do it with freshwater and frequent washes.

So Samūm’s solar infrastructure almost has to lean on:

Electrostatic / vibratory dust shedding skins on panels.

Robot wipers and air jets that use minimal water.

If water is used, it’s:

saline / brine

heavily recycled in local loops

maybe combined with fine ceramic abrasives instead of bulk rinsing.

Net: solar can be designed so that water usage per unit power is very low, at the cost of extra tech and maintenance.

3. Fusion’s water footprint
Fusion eats water in several ways:

Primary cooling loop

Secondary heat rejection (traditionally water-cooled towers)

Tritium / blanket chemistry (needs clean process water)

Shielding / emergency quench systems

On a dry world:

Once-through cooling is impossible.

Even closed-loop water systems need make-up water and high-quality chemistry.

So on Samūm, fusion plants are probably:

Buried near deep brines or ice deposits, or

Clustered at locations where volatiles are imported anyway (e.g., an industrial spaceport).

And they mostly reject heat via:

Dry cooling towers + massive radiators, not open cooling ponds.

Possibly thermal storage (molten salts / ceramics) for load shifting.

Even then, fusion consumes high-grade water, not just mud or brine.

So with water scarcity, each new fusion plant is a strategic decision: “Are we committing some of our best water to this?”

4. Launch tugs: where water really caps things
The launch system is where water scarcity gets interesting.

Things that likely depend on water:

Hydrogen or water as reaction mass in laser/microwave-thermal engines.

Electrolysis to produce hydrogen for any chemical assist stages.

Cooling loops in the tugs themselves (leading-edge and skin cooling).

So you get a nice system-level constraint:

Solar can scale to huge power, but you’re propellant-limited.

Launch cadence is limited by how fast you can:

mine / import water

crack it into hydrogen/oxygen (if needed)

recapture and recycle what survives each launch.

Even if power is cheap, each kilogram to orbit has a water cost somewhere.

That gives you an in-universe reason why:

Orbit isn’t saturated with junk;

Access to orbit is heavily scheduled and rationed;

Water logistics and launch logistics are tightly coupled.

5. Solar vs fusion under water constraints
Putting it together:

Solar
Can operate with very little clean water if you:

Avoid thermal solar with wet towers

Use smart dust mitigation

Accepts dirty water (brines) for occasional washing.

Scales mainly with area, not water.

Fusion
Needs high-quality water for:

coolant

chemistry

safety systems

Each new reactor means a permanent water allocation.

Harder to stick one “just anywhere” on a desert plateau.

So if water is scarce:

Fusion capacity is water-limited first, then politics-limited.

Solar remains mostly area-limited, with water only a secondary annoyance.

That actually reinforces the earlier picture: Samūm leans on:

Huge, lightly-water-using solar fields for:

launch beams

day-side grids

Fewer, carefully-sited fusion complexes where they can justify:

long-term water commitment

deep shielding and cooling infrastructure.

6. If you want to hard-code it into canon
You could state something like:

Each major Comb sits atop:

One deep brine aquifer (industrial, power)

One smaller, cleaner groundwater lens (life support)

Fusion plants are built only where there’s enough brine + imported ice to support them.

Solar fields are explicitly designed with:

electrostatic dust-shedding layers

air-jet cleaning drones

water use capped to X% of industrial water budget (tiny fraction)

And for the launch network:

“Total annual launches are capped not by power, but by the water allocation for tug propellant and cooling.”

That gives you a clean, physically grounded reason why Samūm is both:

A solar superpower, and

Still very conservative about how often, and how massively, they go to orbit.

You said:
I was thinking of fusion fuel source. Other options besides water are better for cooling 
ChatGPT said:
Right, got you: you’re talking about fusion fuel tied to water (deuterium), not water as a coolant.

Let’s separate physics from canon:

1. How much water does D–T fusion actually “eat”?
Standard near-term fusion fuel is D–T:

Deuterium (D) usually comes from water.

Tritium (T) is bred from lithium, not from water.

Order-of-magnitude:

Natural deuterium abundance in water ≈ 0.0156% of hydrogen atoms.

1 kg of water contains ≈ 0.035 g of deuterium.

1 kg of pure deuterium fused with tritium releases ≈ 8.5 × 10¹⁴ J.

So 1 kg of water (via its deuterium) can yield ≈ 3 × 10¹⁰ J.

Convert that to electricity:

1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J →

3 × 10¹⁰ J ≈ 8,000 kWh = 8 MWh per kg of water.

So:

1 m³ of water (1000 kg) → ~8 GWh of fusion output.

1 km³ of water → ~8 × 10¹² kWh, enough for a major civilization for ages.

Conclusion (pure physics):
On any planet with “normal” life-support water (lakes, aquifers, whatever), the amount you’d need to strip for deuterium is vanishingly small compared to total inventory. Water is not a hard physical limit on D-based fusion unless Samūm is extraordinarily dry.

So if you want water to be the limiting factor, it’s less about physics and more about policy and context.

2. Making water a real constraint in canon (if you want that)
You’ve got a few levers:

A. Samūm has almost no native water
If Samūm starts with only:

isolated deep brine pockets

a few protected ice deposits

human-imported volatiles

then even the tiny fraction of water you’d consume for deuterium is politically radioactive:

“Every kg of water we crack is air, crops, or coolant we don’t have later.”

There might be treaty limits on how much deuterium you’re allowed to strip per decade.

Fusion fuel becomes legally water-limited, not physically.

B. Cultural / treaty bans on cracking water for fuel
You can literally encode something like:

After early mismanagement, cracking potable water for fuel is outlawed.

Only brine reservoirs of specified quality can be used as deuterium feedstock.

Anything beyond that must be imported fusion fuel.

Then the limit is: how much off-world fuel can you afford to ship in?

3. Other fusion fuel options that decouple from water
If you don’t want water to be the main bottleneck, you can let Samūm evolve past D-T:

3.1 D–T with imported deuterium
Deuterium doesn’t have to come from Samūm’s water.

It can be harvested in bulk from:

icy moons / comets in the system

off-world oceans

Then shipped as heavy water or deuterium gas.

This makes fusion a space logistics problem: fuel caravans, tanker tugs, piracy, etc.

3.2 D–He³
Uses deuterium (could be imported) and helium-3.

He³ is mostly an off-world resource:

gas giant upper atmospheres

regolith of moons with solar wind implantation

Upside in-universe:

Far fewer neutrons → less activation, easier long-life reactors.

Political upside: power reactors look less like weapons plants.

Downside:

Much harder plasma conditions (higher temperature, lower cross-section), so these are advanced, high-capital machines – maybe only the biggest Comb or a supranational authority runs them.

3.3 p–B¹¹ (proton–boron)
Fuel is hydrogen + boron-11.

Boron is from rocks, not water; hydrogen may be:

from volatiles

from process gas loops (not bulk water)

Pros for story:

Aneutronic: output is mostly charged particles → direct electric conversion → less cooling, less shielding.

It’s clean and politically attractive.

Cons:

Even more extreme conditions than D–He³.

Likely only for special high-end reactors (military, elite research, starship cores, etc.).

In canon, you can do a tiered tech stack:

Old treaty-era reactors: D–T, fuel mostly from strictly limited deuterium extraction.

Prestige / central installations: D–He³.

Experimental / strategic: p–B¹¹.

4. Cooling without water
You already hinted at this, but to make it explicit: on Samūm, you’d almost certainly avoid water as coolant in fusion plants:

Helium-cooled fusion blankets.

Molten salt / molten metal loops for heat transport.

Large radiative panels and dry cooling towers to dump waste heat.

That means:

Fusion’s cooling doesn’t have to consume water at all (or only minimal high-grade water in aux systems).

So if water is a constraint, it’s either:

fuel-side (if D from water), or

completely sidestepped (if fuel is imported / non-water based).

5. How to frame it for Samūm specifically
A clean, consistent setup might be:

Early days:

Pioneers on Samūm used D–T fusion with deuterium stripped from local brines.

This ate into a small water budget and caused real ecological/political damage.

Treaty era:

Cracking local water for fusion fuel becomes heavily regulated or banned.

Existing D–T plants are grandfathered in but capped; new baseload expansions must use imported fuel or advanced cycles.

Present day (your stories):

Baseline power: fusion reactors using imported D and some He³, plus solar.

Solar: main driver for launch beams and local grids.

Water: no longer a physical limit on fusion capacity, but a politically sacred resource. Even if the math says it’s fine, nobody wants to repeat the early damage.

That lets you:

Be physically honest (fusion doesn’t realistically run out of fuel the way a desert runs out of drinking water).

Still make water → fusion fuel a historically important and politically sensitive connection.

If you like, next step we can nail down a canonical statement like:

“By treaty, no more than X ppm of Samūm’s accessible water may be processed for nuclear fuel per century,”
and then we derive what that translates to in actual GW of D–T capacity, vs how much extra you get from imported D/He³.
