## Other combs exports
 Given Samūm's limitations in terms of water and its population of 1.6 million, the Combs' exports focus on leveraging the planet’s strengths—its mining resources, industrial capacity, and technical expertise—while compensating for its challenges with innovative solutions. Here are some possible additional exports from the Combs:

1. Raw and Refined Materials:
Metals and Rare Minerals: As the main terrestrial source of mined metals in the system, the Combs specialize in extracting, refining, and exporting metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and more valuable rare minerals like titanium, platinum, and rare earth elements. These materials are critical for shipbuilding, electronics, and space infrastructure. Note that the Nuudelchid technically have the (literal) upper hand in some mineral and resource mining due to their mastery of asteroid resource extraction - but the process of extraction and refining in space is slow and methodical. The Combs has the upper hand in raw material extraction on a massive scale, being itself a gigantic mining project and cheaply makes many manufacturered goods in the gravity of Samum that would be inefficient to make in space. Much of this market is consumed locally for underground infrastructure expansion, but their is a glut of metal and mineral products on Samum.

### Processed Alloys: 
The Combs refines and combines metals into high-performance alloys used in robotics, infrastructure, and specialized spacecraft components.The Combs is in the lead producing materials with unique properties (e.g., lightweight, heat-resistant) suited for space environments.

### Ship Components and Industrial Equipment:
Spaceship Components: Rather than building entire ships, the Combs exports high-quality components such as gravity rings, propulsion systems, hull sections, and specialized equipment for shipbuilding. The growing demand for ships across the system makes this a key export.

### Heavy-Lift Drones and Robotics: 
Since they produce drones and robotic systems for shipbuilding and other industries, the Combs exports heavy-lift drones, construction robots, and automated systems. These could be in high demand for asteroid mining, space construction, and other off-world industries.

### Mining Equipment: 
Given the Combs' expertise in mining, they also export advanced mining technology, including drilling systems, exoskeletons, and autonomous mining robots designed for use in harsh environments like asteroids or other planets.

### Specialized Manufactured Goods:
Exoskeletons: The exoskeletons used by shipyard workers are a valuable export, especially for colonies on other planets or in space.

### Industrial 3D Printers and CNC Machines: 
The Combs, with their expertise in manufacturing and fabrication, produces and exports advanced 3D printers, CNC machines, and other fabrication technologies.

### High-Tech Engineering and R&D Expertise:
Design and Consulting Services: With their advanced engineering and design capabilities, the Combs owns much export technical expertise in designing new spacecraft, space stations, and orbital infrastructure. While the Nuudelchid excel at building gargantuan craft and also low-tech solutions that are reliable under the most extreme conditions, Engineering firms based in the Combs consult on large-scale construction projects elsewhere in the system.

### Software and AI Systems: 
While the Combs is surpassed by Isrikistjarna in many of the sciences and software and AI expertise, they are often the final integration step of these systems for mechanized systems - giving them the edge in embedded systems and low-level operating systems.

### Luxury Goods and Unique Materials:
Bioengineered Textiles: Although there is limited surface agriculture, Samum specializes in growing a few unique, bioengineered plants like Poatag, a leathery plant used for textiles. These are turned into high-end products like durable clothing, accessories, or upholstery used in starships and habitats.

### Education and Training:
Starship Pilot Academy Graduates: 
The Space Pilot Academy, while directly under the authority of the coalition of planets, is based in the Combs. It has become known as the premier institution for training starship captains and crew members. Graduates from this academy are an important “export,” as these highly trained individuals would be in demand for piloting and operating spaceships across the system. Approximately 1/4 of candidates come from the Combs.

### Technical Apprenticeships and Training Programs: 
The Combs is a hub for training apprentices in various technical fields (engineering, manufacturing, mining). This would attract off-world students and companies looking to upgrade their workforce.


### Energy Storage Systems:
Technologies related to energy storage—such as lightweight, high-density batteries and energy capture systems, particularly power systems for spacecraft. The technology for this is imported from Isreikistjarna.



### Other notes:
Samum is best at water recycling, mining (a literal byproduct of expanding the combs), precision optics (they use lasers to help launch craft in the high gravity, as well as with landing. They are also the only location that can currently create high quality computer chips en-masse. This means that their robotics are highly advanced. They are the major supplier of battery systems. The space economy focuses on shorter range craft, drones and space tugs for orbital operations. The "shipyards" on Combs are relatively new and mostly export partial structures to the "space docks" - which are owned and operated by the Nuudelchid.) 

### High-Precision Optics and Laser Systems:
Precision Optics: Samūm has mastered the production of high-quality laser optics and precision lenses, used in everything from long-range space-based communication systems to targeting arrays for spacecraft. These systems are especially valuable to the Nüüdelchid, who use them in asteroid-harvesting drones, space tugs, and for guiding orbital operations with pinpoint accuracy.

### Laser-Assisted Launch and Landing Systems:
Samūm's harsh gravity has driven the development of powerful laser-assist systems for both launching spacecraft and safely landing them. These systems are exported to the Nüüdelchid to facilitate landings to assist in docking with space habitats. Experts from Samum also developed Sangay's maglev launch system.


### Advanced Robotics and Autonomous Systems:
Industrial Robots: With Samūm's advanced robotics and the ability to mass-produce high-quality computer chips, they have become the leading supplier of industrial robots and autonomous systems. These robots are crucial in shipbuilding, mining, and large-scale construction efforts throughout the system. The Nüüdelchid use these robots extensively in their space docks and asteroid-mining operations.

Maintenance and Repair Drones: Samūm specializes in smaller, repair drones that are highly efficient in tight spaces, such as space stations, shipyards, and orbital habitats. These drones are lightweight and expendable, ideal for hazardous environments.

Mining Drones: Advanced drones tailored for precision deep-core mining are essential on Samūm for expanding the Combs and extracting valuable minerals. These drones are exported to the Nüüdelchid, who use them to reach mineral-rich asteroids in delicate or difficult-to-mine locations.

### Energy Storage and Battery Systems:
High-Density Batteries: Samūm is the top supplier of energy storage systems across the system. Their high-density batteries are used in spacecraft, drones, and space stations, providing long-lasting power in environments where resupply is infrequent or difficult. The Nüüdelchid rely on Samūm’s batteries to power their fleets of asteroid-harvesting drones and space habitats.

### Power Cells:
Smaller power cells for personal and industrial use are exported to other planets and space stations, especially useful in the energy-scarce environments of asteroid mining operations and for powering smaller space vehicles.

### Raw and Processed Materials:
Metals and Alloys: While asteroid mining provides plenty of raw metals, Samūm specializes in processed alloys that are finely tuned for specific environments. Heat-resistant alloys for spacecraft hulls and lightweight, high-strength materials are exported to the Nüüdelchid for use in asteroid harvesters, space tugs, and orbital construction.

Crystalline Silicates and Gemstones: Some crystalline minerals are mined from the deep layers of Samūm’s crust and are impossible to find in asteroid belts. These materials are valuable in high-precision technologies, including laser systems and advanced electronics. Gem-quality crystals are also exported as luxury items, used in high-end electronics and decorative elements on elite starships.

Surface-Mined Silica: High-purity silica harvested by surface dwellers in the desert is crucial for the production of Samūm’s precision optics and electronics. The Nüüdelchid find it more expedient to import this rather than refining their own.

Rare Earth Elements: Extracted from deep within the Combs, these are essential for electronics production, including computer chips and batteries. The Nüüdelchid import these as part of their space infrastructure expansion projects.

### Water Recycling and Environmental Control Systems:
Water Recycling Technology: As masters of water recycling, Samūm exports highly efficient water recycling systems. These systems are used by the Nüüdelchid in their space habitats and the asteroid miners to manage their limited water supply, ensuring nearly 100% water recovery in space environments.

Environmental Control Units: The technology developed in the Combs to maintain habitable conditions underground is exported to the Nüüdelchid and other space-based populations. These units control air pressure, humidity, and temperature, crucial for space stations and underground bases on other planets.

### Advanced Computer Chips and Electronics:
Mass-Produced Computer Chips: Samūm is the only place capable of producing high-quality computer chips on a large scale, making them the primary supplier of advanced electronics for both spacefarers and planetary populations. These chips are integral to the drones, robots, and automated systems used by the Nüüdelchid.

### Bioengineered Textiles and Desert Plants:
Poatag Textiles: The leathery Poatag plant is a unique bioengineered textile crop that grows in Samūm's subterranean farms. It’s incredibly durable and lightweight, making it perfect for spacefaring uniforms, industrial wear, and high-end luxury products. It’s also used for coverings and insulation in harsh climates, both on-planet and in space.

## Imports to Samūm:
* From Nüüdelchid:

### Asteroid-Sourced Raw Metals: 
While Samūm has its own mines, certain rarer metals and materials are more easily sourced from asteroids, making them imports from the Nüüdelchid.

### Spacecraft Components: 
The Nüüdelchid "export" large-scale ship components and space station modules to Samūm's orbital shipyards, but the shipyards are largely controlled and run by a Nuudelchid/Isrikistjarna conglomerate.
The Nüüdelchid provide expertise in orbital construction and zero-gravity assembly techniques, which supplement Samūm’s shipbuilding efforts.

### Bioengineered Lifeforms: 
Bioengineered creatures and plants, adapted to extreme environments, are imported from the nuudelchid to maintain the balance of the Combs’ ecosystem and aid in hydroponics.

With their mastery of bioengineering, nuudelchid exports adapted lifeforms that can thrive in space stations, underwater habitats, or harsh planetary conditions. This includes creatures used in farming, food production, and environmental maintenance on Samum.

* From Ísreikistjarna:

### Water: 
Despite their superior recycling technology, Samūm relies on regular water deliveries from Ísreikistjarna.

### Medical Technologies: 
Ísreikistjarna's expertise in medical technology, AI, and sciences makes it a key supplier of advanced equipment to Samūm.

What Samūm Offers That the Nüüdelchid Cannot Mine Themselves:
Precision Optics and Advanced Robotics: The level of precision in optics and mass-produced computer chips, as well as their advanced robotics, gives Samūm a technological edge. The Nüüdelchid cannot replicate this on their own due to their focus on asteroid mining and space-based operations.

Specialized Alloys and Materials: Certain silicates, alloys, and rare elements found deep within the planet are far more efficiently mined on Samūm than in space, especially with the scale of mining required to expand the Combs.

Medical Breakthroughs: Ísreikistjarna's advanced medical technology and biotechnologies are sought after across the system, from regenerative medicine to biological enhancements and long-term life support systems for spacefarers.
