I have a theory about prince Khalid. In the events leading up to the treaty of Quoath, Isreikistjarna had sent an icy asteroid via several asteroid pushers, trying to relieve the water crisis, it was placed in a low orbit around Samum.. A conflict between the surface dwellers and the Combs over who controlled the new water  led to a mission (by the surface dwellers) to use a stolen orbital ship to seize  the control station on the asteroid (controlling the asteroid pusher drones). I'm not sure what happened or how, but the mission went terribly wrong. The asteroid destabilized and crashed near the combs, destroying hundreds of homes and the loss of life of the members of the relief mission. That is why Isreikistjarna was unwilling after that to help Samum with it's water crisis and also why the treaty has stipulated all spacecraft must be piloted by graduates of the space pilot academy. Back to Khalid though, he was just a baby when this happened. His parent's home was one of the ones destroyed. They both died, and it was many hours in the scorching heat before he was rescued. His lungs and trachea were scarred from the hot air and dust, leading to his raspy voice.



1. Icy Asteroid Delivery from Ísreikistjarna:
Realism: Using asteroid pushers to deliver water to Samum is plausible, especially considering that Ísreikistjarna has already used similar techniques in its own terraforming.

Adjustment: The biggest issue might be the precision needed to keep the asteroid in a stable orbit around Samum. Achieving a low orbit would require a delicate balance of gravity, velocity, and precise control systems. Any error could indeed result in destabilization.

Fix: Suggest that the asteroid pushers are equipped with highly sensitive thrusters and automated navigation systems that help them maintain a delicate orbit. Perhaps the instability arose from a malfunction in the control systems after the surface dwellers seized the asteroid’s control station. A disruption in communications or power could have caused the asteroid to slowly veer off course.

2. Conflict Over Control of the Water:
Realism: A conflict over such a valuable resource as water on Samum makes perfect sense. It's believable that the surface dwellers, living in harsher conditions, would attempt to gain control of the asteroid’s resources.

Adjustment: The mission to seize control of the asteroid sounds plausible, but perhaps the "stolen orbital ship" part could be expanded upon to explain why this mission goes wrong.

Fix: Suggest that the surface dwellers, not having trained pilots or engineers, use a commandeered or hastily adapted ship. The crew could have been unprepared for the complexities of orbital control and asteroid mining systems, leading to their inability to maintain stability. Alternatively, the orbital ship they took could have been an older, under-maintained craft, making the mission more perilous.

3. Asteroid Destabilization and Crash:
Realism: If the asteroid were destabilized, it would likely fall into a decaying orbit and eventually crash. The details around how this crash happens should be clarified.

Fix: Instead of the asteroid immediately destabilizing, suggest a slow, creeping failure in the asteroid’s orbit. Perhaps the asteroid pushers initially kept the asteroid stable, but after the control station was taken, one of the surface dwellers made a miscalculation, gradually worsening the orbit. This gradual destabilization would also create suspense and explain why no one was able to intervene quickly enough to prevent the crash.

4. Impact Near the Combs and Destruction:
Realism: The destruction of homes and loss of life is a natural consequence of such an event.

Fix: For believability, the asteroid should be small enough to be used for water delivery (too large, and the impact would cause planet-wide devastation). It could have shattered in the atmosphere, with large fragments impacting near the Combs, causing the destruction. This would also explain why some homes were destroyed while others weren’t.

5. Scarred Prince Khalid:
Realism: The idea that Khalid was injured as a baby and that his lungs and trachea were scarred from the heat and dust after the impact is plausible.

Fix: To make it even more believable, suggest that Khalid's parents were high-ranking members of the royal family or the government and lived in one of the more luxurious parts of the Combs, making their home a target for a fragment of the asteroid. His injuries could have come not only from the heat but also from breathing in toxic gases released from the asteroid as it disintegrated, adding to his traumatic backstory.

Other Considerations:
Political Fallout: The scenario creates the perfect background for the strained relations between Samum and Ísreikistjarna. The failure of the asteroid water delivery and the tragic loss of life could have made Ísreikistjarna unwilling to risk further interventions, explaining the long-lasting water crisis on Samum.

Treaty of Quoath: The stipulation that all spacecraft must be piloted by Academy graduates would be a logical reaction to prevent future disasters caused by untrained pilots.

Summary of Changes:

The asteroid pushers are equipped with sensitive control systems, but a malfunction or sabotage causes the orbit to destabilize gradually after the surface dwellers seize the control station.

The surface dwellers use a stolen or outdated ship, which leads to the failure of the mission due to their inexperience with orbital maneuvers.

The asteroid slowly enters a decaying orbit, eventually breaking apart and crashing near the Combs, destroying homes and killing many, including Khalid's parents.

Khalid, as a baby, is injured due to heat, dust, and toxic gases from the disintegrating asteroid, leaving him with lasting scars.

These modifications keep the storyline intact but ground it in more realistic science and make the tragedy even more emotionally impactful. Would you like to go ahead with these changes?

How about the realism of getting water to a population then over half a million via icy asteroid? I'm stuck on how they were even planning to pull this off

Delivering water to a population of over half a million via icy asteroid is feasible in theory, but it comes with significant logistical and engineering challenges. Let's break down how this could be done and what the challenges are, and see how we might modify the concept to make it more realistic for your story.

1. Scale of the Water Need:
Realism: Water consumption estimates vary, but for a population of over 500,000 people, assuming efficient recycling systems and extremely conservative usage (like on the International Space Station), you would need at least 50 to 100 liters per person per day for drinking, cooking, sanitation, and agriculture. This adds up to 25-50 million liters of water per day, or 9-18 billion liters per year (about 9-18 million metric tons of water annually). Even if water was partially recycled on Samum, the asteroid would still need to deliver a huge amount of fresh water annually.

Fix: Instead of attempting to meet the entire planet's water needs with one asteroid, it might be more realistic to deliver smaller, regular ice shipments to augment local recycling efforts. The asteroid shipments could be intended to refill existing reservoirs and meet additional demands, rather than being the primary water source. Perhaps the asteroid shipments are expected to arrive in intervals, spaced out every few years to deliver a fresh supply of water, keeping the population going in a sustainable cycle.

2. Asteroid Size and Logistics:
Realism: An asteroid capable of delivering enough water would have to be enormous, and managing its trajectory, orbit, and controlled descent would require immense precision. A large asteroid several kilometers across (to meet annual water needs) would carry too much mass to be safely directed or kept in low orbit without immense risk.

Fix: The asteroid could be much smaller, perhaps only a few hundred meters across, delivering only a fraction of the needed water. Regular smaller asteroids or chunks of ice harvested from comets or Kuiper Belt objects could be delivered in smaller batches via multiple shipments. Each asteroid would need to be carefully broken apart in space before entering the atmosphere, with large chunks de-orbited safely to avoid catastrophic impacts. Alternatively, water processing facilities in orbit could melt the ice into water, then safely lower it to the surface in controlled containers or liquid form.

3. Orbit, Harvesting, and Transportation:
Realism: Placing an asteroid in a low orbit around a planet like Samum would be incredibly difficult and risky. Once in low orbit, the asteroid would constantly face atmospheric drag and gravitational forces, which would require continuous adjustments to maintain orbit.

Fix: Instead of keeping the asteroid in low orbit, have the asteroid remain in higher orbit or park it at a Lagrange point, which requires less energy to maintain. The asteroid could be gradually harvested in space, breaking off smaller pieces and sending them down to Samum via controlled descent systems. These water pods could be equipped with heat shields and parachutes to ensure safe landing, or orbital water tankers could ferry the water from the asteroid to the planet's surface.

4. Transporting Water from Orbit to Surface:
Realism: Even after successfully parking the asteroid, transporting water from orbit to the surface would still pose a major logistical challenge. A single mistake could send tons of water crashing into the planet, causing widespread destruction.

Fix: Water could be harvested gradually in small amounts, loaded into reusable water transport capsules that could de-orbit and deliver the water in small batches. Another possibility is using controlled orbital bombardment, where the ice itself is directed to a controlled entry, breaking apart in the atmosphere and landing in smaller, manageable pieces in designated reservoirs.

5. Political and Environmental Fallout:
Realism: A crash like the one you've described would have massive political and environmental implications. Such a failure could lead to widespread mistrust between Samum and Ísreikistjarna, as well as internal political chaos.

Fix: The aftermath could focus on salvaging what remains of the ice asteroid after the crash. Perhaps only a fraction of the water made it to the surface, leading to water rationing and intensifying the resource scarcity that triggered the war. The treaty that follows could include a ban on large-scale asteroid harvesting, requiring smaller, more precise water delivery methods.

Revised Scenario
To make the icy asteroid delivery realistic, the following steps could be taken:

Multiple Small Asteroid Shipments: Instead of one huge asteroid, Ísreikistjarna regularly sends smaller, more manageable icy asteroids to Samum. These asteroids are kept in higher orbit or at a Lagrange point, where they are gradually harvested.

Water Capsules or Tankers: The harvested water is transferred to smaller capsules or water tankers. These are designed to de-orbit safely and deliver the water to the surface of Samum in controlled landings or via space elevators.

The Failed Mission: A rogue group of surface dwellers attempts to seize control of the asteroid harvesting operation. In doing so, they make a mistake that causes the asteroid or a chunk of it to de-orbit prematurely, resulting in the catastrophic crash near the Combs.

Aftermath: The crash kills hundreds of people, including Khalid's parents. This disaster leads to the Treaty of Quoath, which mandates strict controls over space travel, water deliveries, and who is allowed to pilot ships, effectively centralizing authority with the Space Pilot Academy.

Conclusion
This scenario adds a layer of realism by using smaller, incremental asteroid deliveries rather than one giant shipment. The technological limitations of the surface dwellers lead to the disaster, which fits into the broader political and environmental narrative, while also helping to flesh out Khalid's backstory in a believable way.
