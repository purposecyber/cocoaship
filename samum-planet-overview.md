# Conspectus
General overview of the planet Samūm, detailing the extreme environment, the underground cities (The Combs), the surface dwellers, and the daily challenges of life on a desert super-earth.

---

Life on Samūm is vastly different from Earth, shaped by its extreme environment and harsh conditions. The planet is a desert world with blistering daytime heat and freezing nighttime cold. A single day lasts 812 Earth hours, with temperatures rising from 15-25°C at dawn to as high as 80°C during midday, and dropping to near freezing during the long night.

## The Combs (Underground Cities)
Most of the population—around 1.5 million people—live underground in a network of massive, mined-out spaces called the Combs. These cities are built deep within the planet's surface to avoid the deadly heat and dust storms. Inside, life is densely packed but organized, with bustling marketplaces, residential areas, and gardens. The population is divided into sectors, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and research, each playing a vital role in sustaining the underground civilization. Water is scarce and precious, recycled constantly to support daily life.

## The Surface Dwellers
A smaller population of around 40,000 lives on the surface in various cities or nomadic groups. The largest city, Fasco, is situated in an oasis valley where some water exists, but most surface dwellers live near scattered, deep gorges or plateaus where small streams or underground lakes can be accessed. Nomads roam the deserts, mining valuable minerals or building solar arrays. Life on the surface is grueling, with the need for constant protection from the elements.

## Environment and Geography
The planet's atmosphere is thick, with high pressure. Surface landscapes include vast sandy deserts, rocky plateaus, and deep gorges. The cave systems provide some stability in temperature and provide shelter for feralized bioengineered plants and animals. Surface life is supported by bioengineered vegetation that absorbs moisture from the air at night, while underground life depends on intricate water management systems.

## Daily Challenges
Water is the most critical resource on Samūm, tightly regulated and shared equally among all residents. Natural water does exist in cave systems and deep chasms, in the form of subsurface lakes and streams but there are no surface oceans and much of the desert surface is arid. Most surface agriculture is impossible, so food production happens in controlled underground hydroponic farms. Life expectancy is high, around 100 years, but life itself is physically demanding, especially given the 1.8g gravity. Constant dust storms and sudden sandstorms on the surface create unpredictable dangers for surface dwellers, while the underground cities are relatively stable. Water is rare enough of a resource that a robust exhange exists shipping water from Isrikistjarna in huge megatankers.

## Technology and Society
Technology is advanced, with highly efficient water recycling systems and robust infrastructure. The monarchy of the Combs rules most of the underground population, though power has been shared and decentralized due to treaties with other planets. There is little to no traditional banking, and medical care is decentralized, with a combination of advanced technology and outreach by the nuudelchid reducing the need for large hospitals.
