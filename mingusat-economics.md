# Mingusat System Economics & Logistics

## Introduction
The logistics of the Mingusat system are defined by its unique stellar geography, the necessity of long-haul interplanetary transport, and a high-efficiency owner-operator model. This document outlines the economic principles governing trade between the inner desert world of Samūm, the agricultural hub of Sangay, and the outer ice world of Ísreikistjarna.

## System Layout & Transit Logistics
Trade routes in the Mingusat system are dictated by the orbital dynamics of its three primary inhabited bodies. The relatively compact nature of the system allows for frequent, yet significant, voyages.

*   **Samūm (Inner System)**: 0.55 AU. Population **1.6 Million**. Industrial/Tech Hub.
*   **The Bayan Cluster (0.75 AU)**:
    *   **Sangay**: Volcanic Moon. Population **~10,000**. "The Garden".
    *   **Ísreikistjarna**: Ice Moon. Population **~500,000**. "The Well / The Lab".
    *   **Wayfarer/Space**: Nüüdelchid. Population **~600,000**. Logistics/Mining.

### Transit Logistics: 
*   **Express Transit**: 
    *   *Physics*: High-thrust fusion engines can achieve 7-day transits, but the economics of *margin* favor utilizing the solar sails.
    *   *Perishables and Urgent Passengers*: Reserved for perishables (medical isotopes, live tissue) or high-priority passengers. Costs 3x or more in fuel than standard transit.
*   **Standard Eco-Transit (Samūm ↔ Bayan)**: **14-18 days**.
    *   *Physics*: High-surface-area sails provide 80% of the required Delta-V, minimizing fusion fuel consumption.
    *   *Processing*: The duration is leveraged for "Transit-Aging"—allowing for the fermentation, roasting, drying or other curing of food products during the voyage.
*   **Bulk Drift (The Ice Run)**: **30-45 days**.
    *   *Physics*: Purely ballistic trajectories with minor sail corrections. Used for mass-transfer of non-perishables.

### Shipping Classes: From Leviathans to Cutters
The Mingusat fleet is categorized by the "Energy-to-Mass" ratio required for their mission profiles.
*   **Leviathan-class (500kt+)**: Massive unshielded bulk carriers. These are essentially fusion engines strapped to ice-asteroids or liquid methane bladders from Ísreikistjarna.
*   **Caravan-class (50kt - 150kt)**: General purpose haulers. Modular containers allow for mixed loads of ores, machinery, and processed goods.
*   **Agricultural-class (5kt - 15kt)**: Specialized vessels for semi-perishable goods. They often feature value-added processing facilities, such as fermentation chambers, roastaries, and humidity-locked freezer holds for Sangay’s organics.
*   **Cutter-class (500t - 2kt)**: Personal luxury craft and high-priority couriers. These use high-thrust fusion for "Express" windows, often owned by Samūm’s merchant princes.

### Sangay’s "Soilbound" Exports
While individual stations and planets feed their populations predominantly through hydroponics, Sangay’s volcanic soil produces biologicals that cannot easily be replicated in vats or artificial greenhouses:
*   **Terroir-Specific Stimulants**: High-grade coffee and cacao analogs. While synthetic caffeine is cheap, the 400+ volatile aromatic compounds created by Sangay’s mineral-rich volcanic soil and symbiotic microbial rhizosphere are not economically viable to replicate without real soil and local pollinators.
*   **High-Energy Perennials**: Slow-maturing orchard fruits. The "Spatial Rent" of maintaining a pressurized, climate-controlled hydroponic bay for the 5-10 years required for a tree to reach maturity makes planetary farming the most economic source for slow-maturing fruits and vegetables.
*   **Stress-Synthesized Aromatics**: Spices that only produce their signature flavors when "attacked" by natural elements or stressed by the natural UV fluctuations of the volcanic atmosphere
*   **Luxury Hardwoods**: Slow-growth, high-density timber (e.g., Cinder-Oak) used for high-end aesthetics and structural components on Samūm. Softwood construction materials such as pine are more economically replaced by artificial composites.

### Scale of Logistics: The "Make vs. Move" Equation
Trade usage patterns are driven by the "Weight of Necessity."
*   **Hyper-Local Production**: All worlds are self-sufficient in Energy (Fusion/Solar), Basic Calories (Vat-Grown Algae/Starch, Hydropoically grown Fruits/Vegetables/Grains), and Atmosphere. Moving these is reserved for emergency situations or for very wealthy individuals.
*   **The Export Imperative**: Trade exists primarily for **Complex Goods** (that cannot be manufactured in the local environment or the raw materials cannot be mined locally) and **Biological Luxuries** (that cannot be grown in the local environment).

#### 1. Samūm: The Hungry Industrialist
*   **The Deficit**: Water. Even with 99% recycling, a population of 1.6M loses ~1% annually to industrial processing and basic entropy.
    *   *Calculation*: 1.6M people * ~500L/capita/year (industrial+personal loss) = **800,000 tons of water/year**.
*   **Imports**:
    *   **Water (Ice)**: Bulk shipments from Ísreikistjarna via mass-driver or elevator.
    *   **Bio-Matter**: Luxury foods, some textiles, meat, leather and hardwoods (Sangay), Fisheries (Ísreikistjarna). 
    *   **Raw Metals**: Nüüdelchid asteroid ores (Titanium/Platinum) for the foundries.
*   **Exports**: **High-Value / Low-Mass**.
    *   **Precision Optics**: Laser lenses, comms arrays (Standard on every ship).
    *   **Compute**: The system's only fab for advanced computer chips.
    *   **Poatag Products**: Specialized textiles and derivative products grown on Sangay.
    *   **Luxury Goods**: High-end consumer goods (clothing, jewelry, etc.)
    *   **Robotics and Machinery**: Drones, automated harvesters, and other specialized equipment.

#### 2. The Bayan Cluster (Sangay & Ísreikistjarna)
*   **Sangay (The Garden)**:
    *   **Imports**: **Robotics & Machinery** (Samūm). The sheer difficulty of the terrain and the danger of the environment requires heavy-lift drones and automated harvesters.
    *   **Exports**: **Coffee, Cocoa, Spices, Fruits, Vegetables, Luxury Livestock Products, Tropical Hardwoods**. High-margin luxuries that define "The Good Life" system-wide.
*   **Ísreikistjarna (The Lab)**:
    *   **Imports**: **Consumer Goods** (Samūm), **Raw Ore** (Nüüdelchid - for station and ground construction).
    *   **Exports**: **Medical Tech**, **Intellectual Property** (research licenses), and **Fish** (luxury protein).

#### 3. The Nüüdelchid: The Connective Tissue
*   **Role**: They produce nothing "terrestrial," yet move everything.
*   **Imports**: **Fresh Food** (Vital for morale long-term), **High-End Tech** (Samūm Optics/Chips).
*   **Exports**: **Raw Materials** (Asteroid metals), **Services** (Construction, Repair, Towing).

## Wealth & Incentives: The Post-Banking Era
Branch banking is obsolete. In Mingusat, wealth is held in the three [[Ship's Stock Ledgers]]. These are essentially distributed blockchains that track local assets and transactions. Every time a local transaction is made, it is recorded in the ship's log. The three ships are then able to guarantee the consistency of the Ledgers during regular updates. Only transactions of large value, or that involve interplanetary transactions, have to wait for all three ships to agree on the transaction. Effectively, the ships function as a lose Central Bank; and people's personal devices are able to access their accounts in real time. 

### 1. Currency & Exchange
While the Ledger handles the technical transaction layer, local economies still denominate value in cultural terms.
*   **The Wayfarer Ruble (Nüüdelchid)**: Traditionally backed by reactor-hours and raw tonnage.
*   **The Al-AlSahraa' Dinar (Samūm)**: A fiat currency stabilized by industrial output.
*   **The Stjernevandrer Krona (Ísreikistjarna)**: Pegged to the value of intellectual property patents and research grants.

The economies are interoperable via the **Tri-System Exchange Board**, which sets daily exchange rates to balance the price of a Nüüdelchid shiwright's weld against a Samūm microchip.

### 2. The Stock Market
Stocks and commodity markets vary from one civilization to another. 

#### The Nüüdelchid: The Keel-Bond
For the Nüüdelchid, investment is familial. There are few faceless banks; instead, pilots seek a **Keel-Bond**. The extended family pools resources to furnish the hull and reactor of a new ship. The new captain pays this back not in interest, but in generosity to the family. Credits are exchanged between families, but rarely between individuals within a family. As prolific traders, Nüüdelchid hold the lion's share of foreign exchange, passing it between families in order to support a new humanitarian waystation for miners in the belt as often as in return for services.

#### Ísreikistjarna: The IP Market
On the Ice World, ideas are the primary asset. The stock market functions as an exchange of **Intellectual Property Futures**. Corporations are primarily research institutes, and portfolios resemble collections of grants and patents. Investors buy into a *hypothesis*, betting that a specific lab's breakthrough in cryo-preservation or biotechnology will become the new system standard. Trade with the Nüüdelchid often takes the form of licensing new reactor designs or upgraded alloy formulas. Practical services—from convenience stores to the power grid—are owned by research labs, where the underlying technology is the primary asset. *When you pay for a fish on Ísreikistjarna, you are paying for the use of a proprietary cold-hardy species, a patent fee for the robotics used to harvest it, a fee for the proprietary algae blend it consumed, and a surcharge to fund the grants that imported the necessary materials to the ice.*

#### Samūm: The Guild Structure
The Combs of Samūm are dominated by the **Industrial Guilds**. Investors typically do not back specific factories; they buy into the "Mining Guild" or the "Textile Production Guild," effectively purchasing diversified slices of an entire industry's output. 

For the common worker, compensation is technically paid in **Guild Equity**. Housing, food, and water are debited directly from these shares, creating a closed-loop economy where workers are heavily incentivized to support the stability of their specific Guild. If the guild does well, the members of the guild benefit; typically members of a wealthy guild are able to afford more affluent lifestyles. On the other hand, members of a poorer guild tend to work dirtier jobs, are housed on the lower, rougher levels of the Combs, and have less social mobility. Guild leaders tend to be the wealthiest members of society; often they are owners of companies within their guild, giving them practical say in the direction of the guild. 

Originally a tool of the crown, before the treaty of Quoath, the guilds were a means of exercising the royal family's control over the Combs's various industries. After the treaty, the royal family was limited to 49.9% of the shares in each guild. The rest of the ownership returned to the companies within the guilds. 

Raising Capital: When a guild member sees an opportunity to expand their company, they can raise capital by selling shares to the guild. This entitles the guild to a share of the company's profits, decreasing the company's equity in the guild. Conversely, a company that is doing well can buy guild shares, increasing the company's equity and the share the company keeps of its own profits. A new company, therefore will turn over all profits to the guild until it has paid off its original loan.
