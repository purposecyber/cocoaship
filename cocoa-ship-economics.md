# Cocoa Ship Economics & Trade

## Carrying Capacity
*   **Total Displacement:** ~500-600 metric tons (fully loaded).
*   **Cargo Payload:** **300-400 metric tons** of goods.
    *   *Primary:* Perishable produce and agricultural goods (Coffee beans, Cocoa beans, Fruits and vegetables).
    *   *Secondary:* General cargo, machinery, technical or medical goods (50-75 tons).
    *   *Note:* The ship is also capable of "tethering" a number of containers to the ship for additional cargo space. This space is not heated or refrigerated and only used for stabilized goods. Generally one or two containers are kept attached for additional crew supplies.
*   **Configuration:** 2-3 large refrigerated/climate-controlled holds, plus processed goods storage.

## Operational Model
*   **Trips per Year:** ~7 round trips.
*   **Transit Times (Approx):**
    *   Samum <-> Sangay (0.4 AU): ~14 days.
    *   Sangay <-> Ísreikistjarna (0.2 AU): ~7 days.
    *   *Total Round Trip:* ~42 days (including port time).
*   **Cost Structure:**
    *   **Propulsion:** 50% Solar Sail (Free thrust) / 50% Fusion (Fuel costs).
    *   **Fuel Cost:** Est. $250,000/year (Deuterium/Tritium processing & maintenance).
    *   **Total Operating Costs:** ~$2 Million/year (Fuel, crew wages, maintenance, port fees).

## Financials
*   **Revenue Estimates:**
    *   **Cargo:** ~500 tons per trip (Mix of Coffee/Cocoa).
    *   **Revenue:** ~$2.0 Million per trip.
    *   **Annual Revenue:** **~$14.0 Million**.
*   **Profitability:**
    *   **Annual Net Profit:** **~$12.0 Million**.
    *   *Note:* High margins are driven by the "luxury" nature of the goods and the value-added onboard processing.

## Asset Valuation
*   **Estimated Value:** **$80 Million - $150 Million**.
    *   *Based on Cap Rate (8-15%) on $12M income.*
*   **Comparisons:**
    *   *SpaceX Starship:* ~$50M (structure only) - Cocoa Ship is higher due to specialized life support/processing refits.
    *   *Maritime Shipping:* Less capacity than a container ship, but significantly higher value-density per ton.
*   **Financing (Hypothetical):**
    *   Monthly payments: ~$430k - $800k.
    *   Feasible within the $1M monthly profit margin.

## Commodity Economics
The ship operates by buying raw/semi-processed goods and selling high-value processed goods.

### Coffee
*   **Purchase (Farm Gate):** $1.20 - $2.50 / lb.
*   **Sale (Shipped/Processed):** $4.00 - $6.00 / lb.
*   **Value Add:** Onboard drying and hulling moves product from "Green" to "Ready for Roast".
*   **Processing Time:** 10-30 days (fits within transit window).

### Cocoa
*   **Purchase (Farm Gate):** $1.50 - $3.00 / lb.
*   **Sale (Shipped/Fermented):** $4.00 - $5.50 / lb.
*   **Value Add:** Onboard fermentation and drying. Crucial for flavor development.
*   **Processing Time:** 10-20 days (fits within transit window).
