# Monastery Brothers 
Also descendents of the Nuudelchid.
* Brother Anthony - A brother with medical training at the monastery, who cares for sick people (sometimes with help from robotic assistance - much of medical care is automated by now - but always Brother Anthony gives it a human and compassionate touch). He is also responsible for giving patients tasks appropriate to their level of expertise and ability. 
* Brother Theodore - In charge of hydroponics at the monastery, and teaches traditional ways of growing food to those who come to the monastery. 
* Brother George - The youngest brother at the monastery and the most tech-savvy. He handles the monastery's finances and most of the correspondence with other organizations. 
* Brother Constantine - An old, wise monk at the monastery who is well-read in both theological and classical literature. At nearly 90 years old, he remembers life aboard AlSahra' intersteller ship before arrival. He is a mentor to Janer and has a youthful energy that attracts children. 
* Brother Demetrius - In charge of planning and preparing meals at the monastery as well as daily operations. 

# Amira Layla Al-Sahra'i
Position: Princess Layla is directly in line for the royal family's leadership when her Father passes, but the King's brothers plan to block her rise to power in favor of their own prospects. She keeps a low profile mostly, but has enough prominence that her actions reflect on the Al-Sahra'i name. Her father expects her to uphold their family values and maintain the strength and control over the Combs in order to protect it from selfish influences of others who would seek power.
Upbringing: She grew up in the family palace, surrounded by wealth and privilege, but somewhat isolated from the more human struggles of the common people. Her education was rigorous, including studies about on the family’s history, etiquette, and political maneuvering, but heavily focused on practical skills as well, even technical engineering. She loves the idea of piloting a spaceship, which she dreams of as giving her independence.
Courageous but Cautious: Amira has a strong moral compass and feels deep empathy for others, but she’s cautious about openly challenging her father's brothers, who outrank her while her father is alive. She’s sometimes torn between doing what she feels is right and feeling the need to protect her family from the criticism of the public.
Intelligent and Strategic: Like most members of the Al-Sahra'i family, Amira has a sharp intellect. However, her strategic thinking extends beyond personal or family gain—she’s interested in using her position to make positive change, much like her father, though not as skilled at this at first.
Reserved but Compassionate: While outwardly composed and often reserved due to her upbringing, Amira is quietly compassionate. She feels an internal struggle to balance the façade she has to maintain of regal separation and her genuine care for those around her.
Independent Streak: Her love for piloting and engineering sets her apart from other members of her family. This independence fuels her desire to be more than a pawn in her family’s political games, but she knows that rebelling too openly could lead to consequences and injure her father's tenuous hold on leadership.
Internal Conflict: The constant pressure from her future position leads to moments of self-doubt, but her time at the Academy and her growing friendships begin to solidify her sense of identity both as part of the Al-Sahra'i legacy and also of her own.
