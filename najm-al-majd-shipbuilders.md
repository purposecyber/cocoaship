CEO: Asef

## Facilities
Fabrication Facilities: Maxim's father owns large fabrication plants located in the Combs. These facilities are responsible for manufacturing various components of the spaceships, such as hull plates, internal trusses, and smaller parts like valves and connectors. These plants are equipped with advanced CNC machines, industrial 3D printers, and robotic assembly units.

Heavy Lift Drones and Construction Robots: He owns a fleet of heavy-lift drones and construction robots. These machines are designed for high-precision tasks like moving large components (e.g., rocket engines, gravity rings) into place during ship construction. The robots are modular, allowing them to adapt to different tasks, from welding to assembly.

Exoskeleton Manufacturing and Leasing: The company produces and leases the exoskeletons used by the welders and other workers. These exoskeletons enhance human strength and endurance, enabling workers to operate in the demanding environments of the shipyards.

Materials Processing and Recycling Plants: Facilities dedicated to processing raw materials like metals, composites, and other critical resources needed for shipbuilding. These plants are also capable of recycling old or damaged components, melting down metals, and repurposing materials for new builds.

Design and Engineering Offices: A suite of high-tech offices where engineers, architects, and designers work on blueprints, schematics, and 3D models of new ships. These offices are equipped with advanced CAD software, virtual simulation systems, and collaborative workspaces.

Space Tug Fleet: A fleet of space tugs used to transport large ship components from the surface of Samum to the orbital shipyards. These tugs are essential for moving massive parts like gravity rings and engines into space for final assembly.

Orbital Shipyards: Though the final assembly of ships occurs in space, Maxim's father owns or co-owns sections of the orbital shipyards where his company’s ships are completed. These yards are equipped with docking facilities, robotic arms, and support systems for the final stages of ship construction.

Power Generation Facilities: Since energy is a critical resource, the company owns facilities that generate power for the shipbuilding process. These might include solar farms located near the surface or nuclear reactors deep underground, providing a reliable energy source for heavy manufacturing and fabrication.

Logistics and Supply Chain Networks: A network of transport vehicles, storage warehouses, and supply chain management systems to ensure the timely delivery of components and materials needed for shipbuilding. This includes both surface and subterranean transport systems.

Training and Safety Centers: Facilities dedicated to training the workforce in the use of exoskeletons, drones, and other equipment. These centers also focus on safety protocols, ensuring workers are well-prepared for the hazardous environments of the shipyards.

Launch Facility Stakeholdings: Partial ownership or significant influence in the nearby launch facilities where the completed ships are sent into orbit. This includes launch platforms, fueling stations, and associated infrastructure.

Research and Development Labs: R&D facilities where new ship designs, propulsion systems, and construction techniques are developed. These labs focus on improving efficiency, reducing costs, and developing next-generation spacefaring technologies.

Legal and Regulatory Office: An internal office that manages the legal aspects of shipbuilding, including patent management, regulatory compliance, and international contracts. Given the complexity and scale of space construction, this office is crucial for the company's operations.

## History and Standing
Najm al-Majd is the biggest shipbuilder in the combs, Asef's father had the good fortune of being the recipient of one of the company contracts designed by the king, rather than his greedy brothers. The company had a rocky start, due to pressure against it from the King's brothers, but over time as its name got out and superior structuring gave it the upper hand, it began to gain a respectable reputation. Asef's father passed the company down to Asef, and under his leadership it grew from a small company making a few specific spacecraft systems to one of the most successful businesses in the combs. The company was well poised to grow in response to the booming demand for spacecraft as more pilots became available from the Space Pilot Academy. While the Nüüdelchid are undisputedly the most experienced at building in space, Asef has carved a niche for his company based on inexpensive raw materials available from expanding the Combs. His business works synergistically with the Nüüdelchid shipbuilders rather than in direct competition.

Other businesses have grown in the Combs, but most other companies started under the 49.9% plan have been compelled to put the interests of the King's brothers first - often leading to decisions which benefit the royal family more than the other possible stakeholders. Meanwhile Najm al-Majd has grown, vertically integrated much of their supply chain and assembly steps, and flourished. 

Like the king, the king's brothers have children. One of these is attempting to re-exert the royal family's direct influence on the affairs of the company.
